bounce on planets (angry birds space)
bounce eachother into black holes and stars
can shoot tiny particles that slow you down a bit and slow the other a bit (but need to reload)

get bigger
particles do more and more damage (can be pushed farther away) and can be shot in chuncks (two at a time)

collect points on planets



STUFF TO DO:

when player connects, set a new long to current time millis
- make coords of players send to connected player DONE (weird crashing bug tho)



DONE
once player receives the successfull connect notice, it sets its own long to current time millis
when player sends key presses, it also sends current time millis - long START LINE 80
when server/other player recieves it, they will check if it is under there count (to make sure no time travel happened), then  the difference to move the player extra if needed, or move the player back if needed (like delta but also implement disable delta)

WORKING FOR NOW

Implement system where bounces are in sync

TRY the if x and y are off by a bit set strategy for now


NOW:
SAVE INFO IN A BUFFER OF EACH FRAME   //1.5 seconds for now  
Time it happened, x, y, xspeed, yspeed

PROGRESSED TO HERE:

STUFF HERE           maybe not deleting enough     new system working ok but needs improvements  

      making old state store right and left boolean values                  getoldstate returning null

      HAVE TO CAP THE FPS AT 60 ON SERVER TOO ---done

ALSO, random null pointer exceptions ???

weird null pointer exception     java.lang.NullPointerException
	at com.ajayinkingston.bouncee.server.Main.getOldStateAtTime(Main.java:306)
	at com.ajayinkingston.bouncee.server.Main.onMessageRecieved(Main.java:197)

Exception in thread "Thread-5" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at com.ajayinkingston.bouncee.server.Main.run(Main.java:169)

WORKING GREAT


ON TO NEXT THING



DONE YAYAYAYAYAY
gets check message and sees if at that time we were at that position

if not, then make up for the frames missed with those coordinates in place for whatever was there   (like the server's thing)


HERE:::::::


STARTER::::::::::::::::::::   ABOVE WORKING

doesnt have the max distance for gravoty maybe or gravity is just plain different on server 

IF A PLAYER PRESSED A BUTTON IN THE PAST INSTEAD OF MULTIPLYING BY DELTA TIME, JUST EXTRAPOLATE THE POSITION FROM THERE (run a simulation of them pressing the button since then at 60 fps)     ---put this on client side too



::::::::::::  SHOOTING WORKS BUT NOW MAKE SURE CHECK ONLY TRIGGERS WHEN IT KNOWS FOR SURE SERVER RECIEVED COMMAND:::::::::


OK NOW THE TIMES HAVE TO BE WAY MORE SYNCHRONISED    DEFINETLY SOMETHING NEEDED HERE    :::::::::::::::::::















::::::::::::::::::::::::::::WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::YAYAYAY




::::::::::::::::::       EVERYTHING WORKS, ALL THATS LEFT IS TO MAKE CLIENT SMOOTH OUT SERVERS CHANGES
								Basically, the client can keep the old client running at the same time as the new one and slowly adjust to new data!!!!!

								so have a new player(current x,y,speeds) and slowly up the percentage close to new. If another connects and it is not at 100%, then delete the player and make a new player(current with percents calculated x,y,speeds)





								NOW MAKE SHOOTING TRIGGER TRANSFORMATION PLAYER

other player check is now broken yay...

delta not being used with client player thing




::::::: NOW IMPLEMENT ALL NEW FEATURES TO THE ADDITIONAL PLAYERS IN MULTIPLAYER

:::::::::::::::::LIST OF THEM
							:::::::: old states --and responding to them like server ::::::::DONE ????
							::::::::::: transformationPlayer   --done that
							:::::::::::::::: shooting




::::::::::::::::;;;--------------------------------------TRY GETTING TIME OF OLD STATE FOR DELTA IN PLAYER CHECK

so basically it is reseting threading problems ya and stuff and stuff bt also myabe the precent wrong stuff oj



SOMETIMES WHEN PACKETS PILE UP THERE IS TELEPORTATION      (maybe somehow make it thread safe)

][;;][;];][;][;][;][;][;][;][;][;]
  I guess try and redo it all
];];][;][;][;][;][;][;][;][;][;]

STILL having stuttering issues, and when a lot of people there, school computer like stuttering


TCP PACKETS GETTING CLUMPED

maybe I need to just put it all into an array list of pending actions and do them one after the other

THEN:
	Try to make this work for not client player too.

AFTER THAT:
	try to add other stuff from https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization

EVEN LATER:
	add some sort of interlopation to make the server athoritative changes seem as if you are not changing but just moving speeds (very quicly though)
ANOTHER THING THAT MIGHT HELP:
	locking fps to 30 might be a good idea (basically if the fps is lower than that then run 2 frames instead of just multiplying by delat)
	this should fic client-server incondistancies a bit if the above doesn't work, or just improve it
AND TO SAVE RAM  (AND CPU):
	make client only know about players in a certain radius, and connect/disconnect when players leave and enter radius
IF NOTHING WORKS:
	just make the client wait until the server lets them move and make speeds not add or subtract  (PLEASE DON'T DO THIS)

MAYBE:ALSO:
	kick people if they are lagging badly

	while doing checks stop game code
ANOTHER ONE:
	remove really small planets
	Instructions














Done:

- revamp bounce with 360-atan2(xspeed,yspeed)+angle formula ----IMPORTANT


Later:

Rocket mode (explosions)
Collect star mode (mario vs luigi)  (low amount of people and only a few planets)

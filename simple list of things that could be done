Simple list of things that could be done: brainstorm

Completed âœ”
- making sure this collision system is realistic
	- any issues are just caused by check
- make projectiles move other players
- add player.start back into the mix
- switching to frame count instead of player.start

CURRENT TASK: ...

	- make the resimulation work. Currently it doesn't move the same amount of frames on both client and server

	- fix transformationplayer (it is COMPLETELY non functional)

	figure out what the heck is up with it anyway

	or, just redo it entirely, make it more effecient and clear


TODO: 

- fix that the projectiles spawn just a bit outside the players
- fix improper disconnection (have some way of checking if the player is really connected)
- adding death feature
- check whats up with check, is it really using the method to make sure that teleportations are smooth
	- maybe redo check?
- make check have more leaniency to if something is good, and doesnt need reseting (to prevent so much checking)
- reconnect upon disconnect
	- give uuid to everyone to make sure they can stay connected
	- this is nessesary because of dynamic ip
- save delta in oldstates (so its not always using 1/60)
- make scoreboard
- make arrows (player/planet incoming)
- make sound effects
- revamp graphics
- fix weird android teleportation bug/test if it's still there
- make new planet spawner
- make food be picked up client side, and then checks with server (this could be client asking the server, or the client waiting a bit for the server to respond)
- redo sending to make it not send strings and be more effecient
- only send client the players and planets it needs to deal with (any others can be sent on demand)
- make clicking use up your mass
- make one scoreboard with total score, which includes the mass when you lose it
- add grid/stars/something so you know that you are moving
- upgrade system, similar to diep.io (actually check that site and see how it is)
	- upgrades like, homing missile, bullets pass through player, no gravity
	- bulltes cost mass? only work for certain amount of projectiles
- mobile control system
